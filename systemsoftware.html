        <h2>Now let's explore System Software in greater detail!</h2><br>
        <p>The link between application software and computer hardware is provided by system software. It is a collection of applications that control and regulate the capabilities and functions of computer hardware. Additionally, it makes application applications function properly. The system software is referred to as general-purpose software as it is not designed to carry out a particular function.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Without system software, a computer system cannot function. The computer system can comprehend the end user's instructions thanks to system software. The system software often creates a user interface that the end user interacts with rather than the system software directly.</p>

        <h2>Some Types of System Software</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="types">
    <div class="box">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Operating Systems (OS): </b><br>The operating system is the fundamental piece of system software that controls and arranges hardware resources, offers a user interface, and permits software programs and computer hardware to communicate with one another. Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix are just a few examples.</li>
        <li><b>Device Drivers:</b><br>Programs known as device drivers help the operating system and particular hardware devices communicate with one another. </li>
        <li><b>Firmware:</b><br>On programmable hardware devices, firmware is responsible for low-level functionality and control. Usually, digital cameras, routers, and computer motherboards contain it integrated. These devices' firmware enables efficient operation and communication with the system software.</li>
        <li><b>BIOS/UEFI:</b><br>Initializing and configuring hardware during boot-up is the responsibility of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
    <ul>
        <p class="continue">It performs necessary startup activities and gets the machine ready for the operating system to take command.</p>
        <li><b>Virtualization Software:</b><br>Using virtualization software, one physical computer can run many operating systems concurrently. Virtual computers can be created and managed. In server environments, this technology is commonly utilized to maximize resource consumption.</li>
        <li><b>System Libraries:</b><br>System libraries are sets of functions and precompiled code that offer reusable programming techniques. By providing pre-made solutions for typical tasks like managing input/output operations, networking, and graphical user interfaces, they streamline the software development process.</li>
        <li><b>Utility Program:</b><br>These software packages include a number of tools for managing files and directories, securing the system, and carrying out other maintenance procedures. Software for system optimization, backup, disk defragmentation, and antivirus are a few examples.</li>
